## Internationalization

The process of internationalization is pretty straight forward for Maputnik.

## Add a new language

#### 1. Edit configuration

In order to add a new translation you'll need to add it to the configuration files. Please put it in alphabetical order.

- Open [/i18next-parser.config.ts](/i18next-parser.config.ts) and add the ISO Code of your language to the `locales` array.
- Now, open [/src/i18n.ts](/src/i18n.ts) and add the ISO Code and localized name to the supported languages.

#### 2. Add the localized strings

Refresh the localization to generate a new directory under `/src/locales/` for your new language.

```bash
npm install
npm run i18n:refresh
```

Replace every `__STRING_NOT_TRANSLATED__` value in the newly generated `translation.json` file with the according translation.
Make sure all the keys are translated.

#### 3. Test your new locale

Finally, test your language locally by starting a local instance of Maputnik.

```bash
npm run start
```

Consider adding your name as a helping person for the translation of new features.

## Add localization for a new feature

If you happen to add a feature which needs some text to be translated, update the translation files.
After running, check your working copy for files and add/correct as needed.

```bash
npm run i18n:refresh
```

## Develop

Maputnik is written in typescript and is using [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [MapLibre GL JS](https://maplibre.org/projects/maplibre-gl-js/).

We ensure building and developing Maputnik works with the [current active LTS Node.js version and above](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule).

Check out our [Internationalization guide](./src/locales/README.md) for UI text related changes.

### Getting Involved
Join the #maplibre or #maputnik slack channel at OSMUS: get an invite at https://slack.openstreetmap.us/ Read the the below guide in order to get familiar with how we do things around here.

Install the deps, start the dev server and open the web browser on `http://localhost:8888/`.

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install
# start dev server
npm run start
```

If you want Maputnik to be accessible externally use the [`--host` option](https://vitejs.dev/config/server-options.html#server-host):

```bash
# start externally accessible dev server
npm run start -- --host 0.0.0.0
```

The build process will watch for changes to the filesystem, rebuild and autoreload the editor.

```
npm run build
```

Lint the JavaScript code.

```
# run linter
npm run lint
npm run lint-css
npm run sort-styles
```

## Tests
For E2E testing we use [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

 [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) doesn't starts a server so you'll need to start one manually by running `npm run start`.

Now open a terminal and run the following using *chrome*:

```
npm run test
```
or *firefox*:
```
npm run test -- --browser firefox
```

See the following docs for more info: (Launching Browsers)[https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/launching-browsers]

You can also see the tests as they run or select which suites to run by executing:

```
npm run cy:open
```

## Release process

1. Review [`CHANGELOG.md`](/CHANGELOG.md)
   - Double-check that all changes included in the release are appropriately documented.
   - To-be-released changes should be under the "main" header.
   - Commit any final changes to the changelog.
2. Run [Create bump version PR](https://github.com/maplibre/maputnik/actions/workflows/create-bump-version-pr.yml) by manual workflow dispatch and set the version number in the input. This will create a PR that changes the changelog and `package.json` file to review and merge.
3. Once merged, an automatic process will kick in and creates a GitHub release and uploads release assets.
